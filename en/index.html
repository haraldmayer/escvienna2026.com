Stay informed and start planning your trip.</p> </div> </div> <main> <h2>What to expect</h2> <div><article>
  <p>The <strong>Eurovision Song Contest 2026</strong> will take place in Austria! After the great victory of JJ with his hit <em>"Wasted Love"</em> at the ESC 2025 in Basel, Austria will host for the third time – following the shows in 1967 and 2015.</p>

  <p>Preparations are now in full swing, as several Austrian cities want to host the legendary music competition.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Vienna:</strong> The capital, which already proved in 2015 how to rock such a major event.</li>
    <li><strong>Innsbruck:</strong> Joining the mix – with the famous Olympic Hall as a possible venue.</li>
    <li><strong>Wels:</strong> Competing with a new, modern hall that is expected to be completed by March 2026 just for the ESC.</li>
    <li><strong>Graz:</strong> Also taking a close look at the city hall.</li>
    <li><strong>Oberwart:</strong> Shows great interest – even if challenges such as lack of accommodation exist.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Other cities like <strong>Salzburg</strong> and <strong>Klagenfurt</strong> have already withdrawn their applications, either because they do not have suitable locations or the costs would be too high.</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://orf.at" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ORF</a> and the Austrian government will decide in the coming months exactly where the spectacle will take place.</p>

  <p>One thing is clear: The ESC 2026 will again captivate music fans with two exciting semi-finals and a grand finale.</p>

  <p><strong>Look forward to an unforgettable show in Austria – it's going to be a real highlight!</strong></p>
