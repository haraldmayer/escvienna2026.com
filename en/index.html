Following the great victory of JJ with his hit &quot;Wasted Love&quot; at ESC 2025 in Basel, Austria will host for the third time – after the shows in 1967 and 2015. Preparations are now in full swing, as several Austrian cities compete to host the legendary music contest. Naturally, Vienna, the capital, is a frontrunner after proving in 2015 how to rock such a major event. Innsbruck is also in the game, with the famous Olympiahalle as a possible venue. Wels is in the race too, aiming to shine with a new, modern hall that should be completed by March 2026. Graz is also examining its city hall closely, and even smaller cities like Oberwart are showing great interest despite challenges like a lack of accommodation. Other cities like Salzburg and Klagenfurt have already withdrawn their bids due to either lacking suitable locations or the costs being too high. The ORF and the Austrian government will decide in the coming months where exactly the spectacle will take place. One thing is clear: ESC 2026 will captivate music fans with two exciting semi-finals and a grand finale. Look forward to an unforgettable show in Austria – it will be a real highlight!</p> <h2></h2> <p></p> <p><a href="https://www.booking.com"></a></p> <h2></h2> <p></p> <p></p> <p><a href="https://www.getyourguide.com"></a></p> </main> <footer> <p><a href="/en/impressum/"></a></p> <p></p> <p></p> </footer> </body></html>
