Stay informed and start planning your trip.</p> </div> </div> <main> <h2>What to Expect</h2> <p>The Eurovision Song Contest 2026 will take place in Austria! Following JJ&#39;s great victory with his hit &quot;Wasted Love&quot; at ESC 2025 in Basel, Austria will host for the third time – after the shows in 1967 and 2015. The preparations are now in full swing, as several Austrian cities want to host this legendary music competition. Naturally, Vienna is at the forefront, having already proven in 2015 how to rock such a major event. Innsbruck is also in the mix – with the famous Olympic Hall as a possible venue. Wels is in the race wanting to shine with a new, modern hall that should be completed by March 2026. Graz is also closely examining its Stadthalle, and even smaller cities like Oberwart are showing great interest – even facing challenges like a shortage of accommodations. Other cities like Salzburg and Klagenfurt have already withdrawn their bids due to either lack of suitable locations or the costs being too high. ORF and the Austrian government will decide in the coming months exactly where the spectacle will take place. One thing is clear: ESC 2026 will thrill music fans again with two exciting semi-finals and a grand final. Look forward to an unforgettable show in Austria – it&#39;s going to be a real highlight!</p> <h2>Plan Your Stay</h2> <p>Book your hotel early to secure the best deals:</p> <p><a href="https://www.booking.com">→ Booking.com – Vienna Hotels</a></p> <h2>Discover Vienna</h2> <p>Discover imperial architecture, cozy coffee houses, and a vibrant nightlife during your stay.</p> <p>Want to experience Vienna like a local?
