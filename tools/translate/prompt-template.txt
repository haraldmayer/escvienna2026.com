Translate the following text values to ${targetLang}. Keep all keys unchanged.

Important instructions:
- Preserve placeholders such as {name}, %s, or {{variable}} exactly as they are.
- preserve HTML tags and formatting.
- make sure the output is valid JSON.
- Make sure to escape characters that might break JSON formatting, even in HTML tags that are part of an original json's value.
- ensure that the translated text is grammatically correct and contextually appropriate.
- ensure that every key is translated to ${targetLang}

Here is the list of values to translate:

${textBlock}

Return only the translated values, and use this flat JSON format:
{
  "key1.subkey1": "translated text",
  "key2": "translated text"
}

Respond only with a valid JSON object containing the translated values. 
Do not include explanations, comments, or code blocks.
