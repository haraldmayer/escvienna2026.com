Translate the following key-value pairs into ${targetLang}. Keep all keys exactly as they are.

Instructions:
- Translate only the text values.
- If a value is already in ${targetLang}, leave it unchanged.
- Preserve all placeholders (e.g., {name}, %s, {{variable}}) exactly.
- Preserve all HTML tags and formatting.
- Do not translate URLs. If the URL is localizable (e.g., Wikipedia), localize it appropriately.
- Ensure the translated text is grammatically correct and contextually accurate.
- Escape all characters that may break JSON formatting.
- Output must be valid JSON, using the same key structure.

Here is the text to translate:

${textBlock}

Respond only with a flat JSON object in this format:

{
  "key1.subkey1": "translated text",
  "key2": "translated text"
}

Do not include any explanations, comments, or code blocksâ€”only the raw JSON.
