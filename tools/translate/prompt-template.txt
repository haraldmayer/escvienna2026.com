Important instructions:

- Keep terms distinct to our Salesforce DevOps solution like "Hutte", "Pool", "Deployment", "Pipeline", "Snapshot", "Scratch Org", "Sandbox" etc. in English
- Just like all other translations, transcribe them using local scripts for non-Latin languages where applicable
- ensure that the translated text is grammatically correct and contextually appropriate.
