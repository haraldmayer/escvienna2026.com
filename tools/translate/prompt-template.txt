Translate the following text values to ${targetLang}. Keep all keys unchanged.

Important instructions:
- Preserve placeholders such as {name}, %s, or {{variable}} exactly as they are.
- preserve values in double brackets [[]] in original language (those are typically brand names) but remove the double brackets.
- preserve HTML tags and formatting.
- make sure the output is valid JSON.
- Make sure to escape characters that might break JSON formatting. Also in HTML tags that are part of an original json's value.
- Align terminology with Salesforce usage wherever applicable.
- ensure that the translated text is grammatically correct and contextually appropriate.
- ensure that every key is translated. 
- exercise QA that no keys are missing or incorrectly translated.
- if the key starts with "lang.", do not translate it.

Here is the list of values to translate:

${textBlock}

Return only the translated values in this JSON format:
{
  "key1": "translated text",
  "key2": "translated text"
}

Respond only with a valid JSON object containing the translated values. Do not include explanations, comments, or code blocks.
